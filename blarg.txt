ran into issue with js/css trying to load from old WEB_SERVER in DBDefs.pm

when trying to create a new clean db, ran into:
Can't locate JSON.pm in @INC (you may need to install the JSON module) (@INC contains: /home/briaguya/code/musicbrainz-server/admin/../lib /etc/perl /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.32.1 /usr/local/share/perl/5.32.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl5/5.32 /usr/share/perl5 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.32 /usr/share/perl/5.32 /usr/local/lib/site_perl) at /home/briaguya/code/musicbrainz-server/admin/../lib/DBDefs/Default.pm line 32.

ran sudo cpan JSON

ran sudo -u postgres ./admin/InitDb.pl --createdb --clean

Can't locate aliased.pm in @INC

ran cpanm --installdeps --notest .

Can't locate aliased.pm in @INC (you may need to install the aliased module)

sudo cpanm --installdeps .

turns out that was because i was trying to run as postgres i think

anyways, the actual issue with the DBDefs.pm webserver stuff was needing to rebuild the static web resources
./script/compile_resources.sh
